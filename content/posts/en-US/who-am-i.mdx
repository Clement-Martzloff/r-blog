I’m **Clément Martzloff**, a Full Stack TypeScript Developer with **6+ years** of experience turning ideas into web apps — often fueled by good espressos.

Currently **open to new opportunities**, whether it's a **full-time position** or a **freelance mission**. Let’s build something together!

## Philosophy

My work is grounded in **clean code principles**, **agile collaboration**, and **user-first thinking**. A few things I’m proud of:

- Reduced production incidents by **30%** and sped up APIs by **20%** for a 10k-display SaaS at VitrineMedia.
- Optimize a **CI/CD transformation**, cutting build times using GitLab CI/CD.
- Set up **real-time monitoring** dashboards with Grafana for actionable insights at a glance.
